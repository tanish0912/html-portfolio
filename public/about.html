<h1>About Me</h1>

I began my academic path at New Era High School in Panchgani, where I embarked on a three-year journey through grades 8th, 9th, and 10th in a boarding school, acquiring valuable life experiences along the way.

  One of my true passions lies in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning. The potential for innovation and problem-solving in these domains has always fascinated me, and I continue to explore and learn in these areas. But that's not all â€“ I'm not just about algorithms and data. I'm also a full-stack web developer, proficient in crafting the digital landscapes of the internet. Whether it's designing sleek user interfaces or building robust back-end systems, I thrive in the dynamic world of web development.
